# UAS 2025-26 Software Team Coding Assessment

Welcome to the 2025-26 coding assessment for UBC UAS! This exercise will evaluate your ability to write clean, maintainable code and refactor existing messy code.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" in the top right corner
3. Create your account with a professional username (e.g., firstname-lastname)
4. Choose the free plan when prompted
5. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Clone This Repository

1. While logged into GitHub, go to the original assessment repository (link provided separately)
2. Copy the repository URL from the green "Code" button
3. You'll clone this repository directly to work on it locally

### Step 3: Install GitHub Desktop

#### Windows & Mac

1. Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Download and install GitHub Desktop
3. Launch GitHub Desktop
4. Sign in with your GitHub account

#### Linux

GitHub Desktop isn't officially available for Linux, but you can:

- Use git command line (see alternative instructions below)
- Or try the unofficial Linux version at [github.com/shiftkey/desktop](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop)

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

#### Using GitHub Desktop (Recommended)

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click "Clone a repository from the Internet"
3. Paste the repository URL you copied earlier
4. Choose where to save it on your computer (remember this location!)
5. Click "Clone"

#### Alternative: Using Command Line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ORIGINAL_REPO_URL/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### Step 5: Make Repository Private and Add Collaborators

1. Go to your cloned repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone" and click "Change repository visibility"
4. Select "Make private" and confirm
5. Go to "Manage access" in the left sidebar
6. Click "Invite a collaborator" and add the following users:
   - ramjayakumar21
   - maplesyrup-0606
   - ubc-uas

### Step 6: Install Python

#### Windows

1. Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.8 or newer
3. **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Open Command Prompt and type `python --version` to verify

#### Mac

1. **Option 1 - Official installer:**
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Download and install Python 3.8 or newer
2. **Option 2 - Using Homebrew (if you have it):**
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
3. Verify with `python3 --version` in Terminal

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

Verify with `python3 --version`

### Step 7: Running the Code

1. Navigate to your cloned repository folder
2. Open terminal/command prompt in that folder
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python calculation.py
   ```
   (On Mac/Linux you might need `python3` instead of `python`)

## Your Assignment

You'll be working with a Python script that converts GPS coordinates for drone navigation. The current code works but is messy and hard to maintain.

### What You'll See Initially

When you first run the script, you'll see:

- Several **FAILED** tests - this is expected!
- The current messy output from `show_drone_locations()`
- Clear error messages showing what's wrong

### Tasks to Complete

#### 1. Implement the Helper Function

- Complete the `convert_to_readable_format()` function
- Follow the step-by-step comments inside the function
- Make the unit tests pass

#### 2. Refactor the Main Function

- Clean up `show_drone_locations()` to use your helper function
- Hint: Variable names are one thing to improve!

#### 3. Verify Your Work

- Run the script again
- All tests should now **PASS**
- The output should be clean and readable

### Success Criteria

Your solution is complete when:

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] `show_drone_locations()` uses your helper function


## Step 8: Commit and Push Your Changes

### Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You should see your changes listed on the left side
3. Write a clear commit message describing what you did (e.g., "Implement helper function and refactor coordinate conversion")
4. Click "Commit to main"
5. Click "Push origin" to upload your changes to GitHub

### Using Command Line

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Some commit message here"
git push origin main
```

## Submission

When complete, please share the link of your GitHub repository containing your work in the Google Form submission.

**Your repository link should look like:**
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/repository-name`

Make sure the repository collaborators (ramjayakumar21, maplesyrup-0606, and ubc-uas) have access to review your code.
